# memeLounge

This application can be started by:

1. Executing the command "npm install" in the terminal
2. Starting the server by going to the folder "server" > "start.bat"

The application's server, html design and css styles come ready from SoftUni Academy.

The aim of this application is to show different meme posts.

The "All Memes" page shows all meme posts.

The "details" page shows a view of a meme post and is provided with buttons "back", "edit" and "delete", however, only the creator of the relevant post can edit and delete it.

The "create" page allows you to create more meme posts.

The "my profile" page allows you to see only the meme posts that you have created
